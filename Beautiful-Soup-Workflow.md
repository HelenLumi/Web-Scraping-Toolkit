# Beautiful Soup Workflow
_This workflow will help you use beautiful soup in Python to put together useful data sets. It will assume very basic programing knowledge such as how for loops and if statements work._
***
### Set up:
* The first step is to install some dependencies for Beautiful Soup. First make sure that you have Python 3 on your machine. Then, open a new terminal and type the commands:
    ~~~
    pip install requests
    pip install bs4
    pip instal lxml
    ~~~
* Now, open a new document in a text editor of your choice. You should save the file as a Python document by using the extension ".py". I will refer to my document as "scraping.py."
* Include the folling at the begining of your document:
    ~~~
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    ~~~
